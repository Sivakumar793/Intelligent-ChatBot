Step 1: Open browser and navigate to Google Colab.
Create a new notebook by selecting New Notebook from the Colab home page.

Step 2: Install Required Python Libraries
Google Colab typically has the required libraries installed, but in case they’re not, you will need to install them.

In the first cell of your Google Colab notebook, install the requests library using the following code:

       !pip install requests

Step 3: Obtain Your Groq API Key
To authenticate your requests to the Groq API, you'll need an API key.

    Log into your GroqCloud account.
    Navigate to the API section in your dashboard.
    Generate a new API key or retrieve an existing one.
    Copy the API key for use in your Colab notebook.


Step 4: Set Up Your API Key in Colab
In a new cell in your Colab notebook, set the API key using this code:


    api_key = "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"  

Make sure the API key is correctly set by checking if it's properly assigned.

Step 5: Define the API Endpoint URL


    url = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models"
    https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions


Step 6: Send a GET Request to the API
You will now send a GET request to the API using the requests library.

In the next cell, write the following code to send the request and handle the response:

    import requests

    # Set the headers to include the API key for authentication
    headers = {
       "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"  # Add the Bearer token in the header
    }

    # Send a GET request to the API
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
    if response.status_code == 200:
      print("Successfully connected to Groq API!")
    # Parse and print the response data
      data = response.json()
      print("Response Data:", data)  # Display the data returned by the API
    else:
      print(f"Failed to connect. Status code: {response.status_code}")

Step 7: Handle the API Response

Successful Response (status code 200): If the request is successful, the API will return data in JSON format. You can parse this data and use it as needed.

Example output:

    Successfully connected to Groq API!
    Response Data: {
    "models": [
        { "model_name": "GroqModel1", "version": "v1", "description": "Model 1 description" },
        { "model_name": "GroqModel2", "version": "v2", "description": "Model 2 description" }
    ]
    }
    Unsuccessful Response:

    401 Unauthorized: This means the API key is missing or incorrect.
    404 Not Found: The endpoint URL might be incorrect.
    500 Internal Server Error: There’s an issue with the API server.

Step 8: Process and Use the Data
Once you receive the JSON response, you can access and process the data.

    # Access the list of models from the response
    models = data.get("models", [])
    print("Available Models:")
    for model in models:
          print(f"Model Name: {model['model_name']}, Version: {model['version']}, Description: {model['description']}")

Step 9: Troubleshooting
If the API request fails, check the following:

Ensure API Key is Correct: Double-check that the API key is valid and placed in the headers correctly.
Check the Endpoint URL: Verify that the API endpoint is correct. For example, https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models should match the documentation.

Check API Documentation: Review the API documentation to ensure you're using the correct request type (GET, POST, etc.) and passing the necessary parameters.
Step 10: Further Interactions with the Groq API
After successfully interacting with the API, you can explore other API endpoints based on the documentation.

    For example:

    Sending data to initiate a job.
    Checking job status.
    Retrieving results of completed tasks.
    Refer to the Groq API documentation for further endpoints, request formats, and response handling.
